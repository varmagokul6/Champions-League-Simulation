# Soccer Tournament Simulation Program
NOTE: I have deleted some parts of the code for fixing.

After learning Python, I decided that I wanted to engage myself in a coding project that would allow me to use all of the concepts that I had learned while perhaps learning some new concepts. And as an avid fan of simulations and soccer, I decided to create a program that would simulate the UEFA Champions League tournament.

The program starts off with each domestic league in the biggest European nations fighting for the top spots in their respective leagues. Based on those results, the top four clubs from each country are taken and placed into a European tournament to claim the title of the best club in Europe.
